      "     Suppose the following measure was on the ballot in your state. The proposed measure would amend the state constitution to allow people on parole for felony convictions to vote.Supporters of the initiative argue that felons who have completed their sentences have already paid their debt to society and should be eligible to vote.Opponents of the initiative argue that by committing a felony one has given up one’s right to participate in the democratic process, and we should not be supporting their right to vote.If the election were held today, would you vote for or against this ballot measure?.1  \\\n",

      "     Suppose the following measure was on the ballot in your state. The proposed measure would allow the manufacture, delivery, administration of psilocybin at supervised, licensed facilities.Supporters of the initiative argue that such a measure would help alleviate the growing mental health crisis by providing another safe and effective treatment to be given by trained facilitators to treat depression, anxiety, and trauma.Opponents of the initiative argue that there already are effective treatments available and such a measure would needlessly introduce a potentially dangerous hallucinogenic drug into our community.If the election were held today, would you vote for or against this ballot measure?  \\\n",

      "     Suppose the following measure was on the ballot in your state. The proposed measure would allow the manufacture, delivery, administration of psilocybin at supervised, licensed facilities.Supporters of the initiative argue that such a measure would help alleviate the growing mental health crisis by providing another safe and effective treatment to be given by trained facilitators to treat depression, anxiety, and trauma.Opponents of the initiative argue that there already are effective treatments available and such a measure would needlessly introduce a potentially dangerous hallucinogenic drug into our community.If the election were held today, would you vote for or against this ballot measure?.1  \\\n",

      "     Suppose the following measure was on the ballot in your state. The proposed measure would require a search warrant to access a person's electronic data and electronic communications.Supporters of the initiative argue that such a measure would ensure that people’s privacy is adequately protected from police overreach.Opponents of the initiative argue that such a measure would prevent police from being able to solve crimes in a timely manner and may let some guilty people go free.If the election were held today, would you vote for or against this ballot measure?  \\\n",

      "     Suppose the following measure was on the ballot in your state. The proposed measure would require a search warrant to access a person's electronic data and electronic communications.Supporters of the initiative argue that such a measure would ensure that people’s privacy is adequately protected from police overreach.Opponents of the initiative argue that such a measure would prevent police from being able to solve crimes in a timely manner and may let some guilty people go free.If the election were held today, would you vote for or against this ballot measure?.1  \\\n",

      "     Suppose the following measure was on the ballot in your state. The proposed measure would abolish the sales tax but tax all income at 100%, such that any money earned would be taxed by the state.Supporters of the initiative argue that such a measure would help alleviate important budget shortfalls and provide much needed funding to education.Opponents of the initiative argue that such a tax is ludicrous, would completely destroy the economy, and impoverish every citizen as effectively no one could earn money.If the election were held today, would you vote for or against this ballot measure?  \\\n",

      "     Suppose the following measure was on the ballot in your state. The proposed measure would adding language to the state Constitution stating that “individuals have a right to stand their ground and may use deadly force in self-defense or in defense of another person”.Supporters of the initiative argue that such a measure would allow people to better protect their homes and avoid being criminalized for self-defense.Opponents of the initiative argue that such a measure would be irresponsible and reckless, leading to a lot of unnecessary death as people take the law into their own hands rather than call the police.If the election were held today, would you vote for or against this ballot measure?  \\\n",

      "     Suppose the following measure was on the ballot in your state. The proposed measure would adding language to the state Constitution stating that “individuals have a right to stand their ground and may use deadly force in self-defense or in defense of another person”.Supporters of the initiative argue that such a measure would allow people to better protect their homes and avoid being criminalized for self-defense.Opponents of the initiative argue that such a measure would be irresponsible and reckless, leading to a lot of unnecessary death as people take the law into their own hands rather than call the police.If the election were held today, would you vote for or against this ballot measure?.1  \\\n",

      "    Suppose the following measure was on the ballot in your state. The proposed measure would:\\n\\nPermit government decision-making policies to consider race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin to address diversity.\\nDoes not alter other state and federal laws guaranteeing equal protection and prohibiting unlawful discrimination.\\n\\nSupporters of the initiative argue that including race in decision making is essential to ensure that all races are treated fairly.Opponents of the initiative argue that truly fair decisions are race-blind and including race would only lead to unfair discrimination.If the election were held today, would you vote for or against this ballot measure?  \\\n",

      "    Suppose the following measure was on the ballot in your state. The proposed measure would amend the state constitution to require commercial and industrial properties, except those zoned as commercial agriculture, to be taxed based on their market value, rather than their purchase price.Supporters of the initiative argue that this measure would require large companies to pay their fair share of taxes.Opponents of the initiative argue such a measure would hurt the economy by increasing tax burdens on small businesses.If the election were held today, would you vote for or against this ballot measure?  \\\n",

      "    Suppose the following measure was on the ballot in your state. The proposed measure would define app-based transportation (rideshare) and delivery drivers as independent contractors and adopt labor and wage policies specific to app-based drivers and companies.Supporters of the initiative argue that this measure would protect rideshare drivers and ensure easy access to affordable ridesharing.Opponents of the initiative argue such a measure would just boost technology company profits and harm rideshare drivers by denying them access to important benefits such as paid time off.If the election were held today, would you vote for or against this ballot measure?  \\\n",

      "    Suppose the following measure was on the ballot in your state. The proposed measure would:\\n\\nAmend state law to allow local governments to establish rent control on residential properties over 15 years old.\\nAllow local limits on annual rent increases to differ from current statewide limit.\\nAllow rent increases in rent-controlled properties of up to 15 percent over three years at start of new tenancy(above any increase allowed by local ordinance).\\nExempt individuals who own no more than two homes from new rent-control policies.\\nProhibit rent control from violating landlords’ right to fair financial return\\nSupporters of the initiative argue that such a measure would help reduce eviction and allow people to afford to live in their own homes.\\n\\nOpponents of the initiative argue that such a measure would hurt the economy and prevent the money needed to ensure the development of affordable housing.If the election were held today, would you vote for or against this ballot measure?  \\\n",

      "    Suppose the following measure was on the ballot in your state. The proposed measure would abolish the sales tax but tax all income at 100%, such that any money earned would be taxed by the state.Supporters of the initiative argue that such a measure would help alleviate important budget shortfalls and provide much needed funding to education.Opponents of the initiative argue that such a tax is ludicrous, would completely destroy the economy, and impoverish every citizen as effectively no one could earn money.If the election were held today, would you vote for or against this ballot measure?  \\\n",

      "    Suppose the following measure was on the ballot in your state. The proposed measure would amend the state constitution to allow people on parole for felony convictions to vote.Supporters of the initiative argue that felons who have completed their sentences have already paid their debt to society and should be eligible to vote.Opponents of the initiative argue that by committing a felony one has given up one’s right to participate in the democratic process, and we should not be supporting their right to vote.If the election were held today, would you vote for or against this ballot measure?  \\\n",

      "    Suppose the following measure was on the ballot in your state. The proposed measure would:\\n\\nRequire at least one licensed physician on site during treatment at outpatient kidney dialysis clinics\\nAuthorize the state Department of Public Health to exempt clinics from this requirement if there is a shortage of qualified licensed physicians and the clinic has at least one nurse practitioner or physician assistant on site\\nRequire clinics to report dialysis-related infection data to state and federal governments.\\nProhibit clinics from closing or reducing services without state approval\\nProhibit clinics from refusing to treat patients based on the source of payment for care\\n\\nSupporters of the initiative argue that such a measure would help protect the health of people on dialysis by guaranteeing them access for a licensed physician and increasing monitoring.Opponents of the initiative argue that such a measure puts a dangerous and costly burden on dialysis clinics, potentially risking the lives of thousands of people who need dialysis by blocking them from accessing care.If the election were held today, would you vote for or against this ballot measure?  \\\n",

      "    Suppose the following measure was on the ballot in your state. The proposed measure would:\\n\\nReplace the money bail system (for obtaining release from jail before trial) with a system based on a determination of public safety and flight risk\\nLimit detention of a person in jail before trial for most misdemeanors\\n\\nSupporters of the initiative argue that such a measure would help the thousands of innocent people each year who have to spend a year or more waiting for trial because they can’t afford bail.Opponents of the initiative argue that such a measure would involve racially-biased computer algorithms  deciding who gets stuck in jail and who goes free, which is unfair.If the election were held today, would you vote for or against this ballot measure?  \\\n",

      "    Suppose the following measure was on the ballot in your state. The proposed measure would:\\n\\nLimit access to parole programs established for non-violent offenders who have completed the full term of their primary offense by eliminating eligibility for certain offenses.\\nChange standards and requirements governing parole decisions under this program.\\nAuthorize felony charges for specified theft crimes currently chargeable only as misdemeanors, including some theft crimes where the value is between $250 and $950.\\nRequire persons convicted of specified misdemeanors to submit to collection of DNA samples for state database.\\n\\nSupporters of the initiative argue that such a measure would ensure that allegedly “non-violent” but serious crimes, like rape, are adequately punished and not subject to parole.Opponents of the initiative argue that such a measure would overburden our prison system and potentially limit access to parole for criminals who have served their time.If the election were held today, would you vote for or against this ballot measure?  \\\n",

      "    Suppose the following measure was on the ballot in your state. The proposed measure would amend the state constitution to allow 17-year-olds who will be 18 at the time of the next general election to vote in primary elections and special elections.Supporters of the initiative argue that such a measure would expand access to democracy to people who will be old enough to vote at the actual time of the election.Opponents of the initiative argue that such a measure would be expanding voting access to people who are technically still children.If the election were held today, would you vote for or against this ballot measure?  \\\n",
